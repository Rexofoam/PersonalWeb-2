								<span class="image main"><img src="images/kr.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>During my free time in the past, I worked on an indexing system for one of my all time favourite game, King's Raid. Somewhere of the mid 2018, was the first iteration of my indexing system for the game, but was soon takes down after a year due to lack of maintainence and compatibility issues with mobile view. Yet, I often find my self as a contributer in Wikipedias on the game King's Raid.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pc.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>PC building is one of my main project which acts as my side income, it consists of fixing older system and/or upgrading them as well as building state of the art gaming machines capable of running the most demanding Triple-A games today. With tiny margin of profit ranging from 1-5% for PC building I find it less of a source of revenue, rather a hobby that I favor.</p>
